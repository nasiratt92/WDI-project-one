### introduction
A simple game created using vanilla javascript and Jqueary to help web developers remember funky and cool placeholder **** names when creating web pages. Injecting bytes of fun into coding and laughter when teaching coding.

The colour names have been chosen specifically on the basis that do not give away the colour name in the name and are very short or very intriguing, making this game a memorisation tool that is fun and useful.
### requirements
On the grid click the correct *** corresponding to the displayed **** name.
### bonus
See if you can complete the game with less than 5 wrong guesses.
